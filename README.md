# Python Challenges: PyBank and PyPoll

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for two real-world financial and election analysis tasks, PyBank and PyPoll. In PyBank, the financial records of a company are analyzed, including total months, net profit/loss, average change, greatest profit increase, and greatest profit decrease. In PyPoll, poll data from a small town is analyzed, including the total number of votes, candidate statistics, and the election winner.

## PyBank
In the PyBank challenge, a Python script is used to analyze financial data. The script calculates:
- Total months included in the dataset.
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

**Financial Analysis**<br>
Number of Months: 86<br>
Net Total: $22,564,198<br>
Average Change: $-8,311<br>
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1,862,002)<br>
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1,825,558)

## PyPoll
In the PyPoll challenge, a Python script is used to modernize vote-counting in a small town. The script calculates:
- Total number of votes cast.
- A complete list of candidates who received votes.
- The percentage of votes each candidate won.
- The total number of votes each candidate won.
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

**Election Results**<br>
Total Votes: 369,711<br>
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85,213)<br>
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272,892)<br>
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11,606)<br>
Winner: Diana DeGette

In addition to printing the analysis to the terminal, the scripts also export the results to text files.
